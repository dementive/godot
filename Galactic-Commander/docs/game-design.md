# Galactic Commander Game Design

The player is a galactic commander leading their starship in the colonization of a new galaxy after being sent through a wormhole in the year 2500.

There are several other galactic commanders that the player will compete/cooperate with to colonize the galaxy.

Galactic commanders control their colonies and structures and benefit from all of their outputs.

## Economy

The economy is made up of resources that are obtained from owned planets, asteroids, or space stations.
These resources can then be used to progress in the game by building more structures or researching better technology.

## Combat

Ships will engage in combat when two galactic commanders are at war with each other.

Combat will be real time space combat and can occur anywhere in the galaxy at any time if enemy commanders run into each other.

Before the battle the game will pause and give the player some options and an overview kind of like how total war battles work.

When destroying a ship in combat it's remains will stay in space where it was destroyed and it can be looted after the battle is over.

## Diplomacy

Galactic commanders can engage in diplomacy with each other.
Diplomacy will be extremely simple with only 5 different relations between galactic commanders.

1. Partnership
	A "partnership" can be entered with any number of other galactic commanders.
	Galactic commanders that are in a partnership with each other will share all resources between them.
	Partner's in partnerships may decide to backstab their other parnter's so one has to be careful with who they trust...

2. Ally
	Two galactic commanders ally together to help each other in war and make trade between them more effective.

3. Neutral
	Two galactic commanders know of each other and have neutral relations with no benefits or downsides to either side.

4. Unknown
	Two galactic commanders don't know that each one exists.

5. Enemy
	Two galactic commanders are actively at war.


## Trade

The player can initiate one time trades for resources with other galactic commanders.

The player can establish trade routes with other galactic commanders that act as recurring trades for different resources.

## 4 Core Resources

1. Research

	Research is a simple value representing the technological progress the player has made throughout the game.

	Research has a passive gain at all times.
	Research is obtained from structures and special events.
	Research is spent on technologies, structures, and ships.

2. Minerals

	Minerals are basic resources required to construct everything.
	There are many different kinds of "sub-minerals" that can be combined to create "refined minerals".
	There are also different kinds of "refined minerals" that are used to build advanced structures.

	Minerals are only obtained from structures, different Stellar Bodies produce different minerals.
	Minerals are spent on structures and ships.


3. Energy

	Energy is a simple value representing basic power required to operate almost all structures.

	Energy is obtained from structures and has a passive gain.
	Energy is spent on technologies, structures, and ships.

4. Goods

	Goods are everything produced by structures for consumption.
	Goods can be food, consumer goods, or other goods needed for a space colonies to survive.
	There are many different kinds of "sub-goods" that are used for different things in the economy.

	Goods are only obtained from structures and special events.
	Goods are spent to maintain colonies, as colonies grow more goods will be needed to sustain them.



## Technology

Technology represents the technological progress of the player. The year is already 2500 so many technologies are already known.
More advanced tech can be researched to progress in the game.

Technology will be represented in a tree structure in a zoom area kind of like imperator or vic3.
There will be one single massive technology tree with a lot of branching and tech.
Ideally the path you take down the technology tree determines the style of game play the player experiences.
So some technologies should unlock special mechanics that are otherwise impossible to get
The player should have to choose the path to take in the tech tree as not all special mechanics will be possible to unlock.

Technology will unlock new structures, new ships, and more advanced production techniques so energy, goods, and minerals can be produced faster.

## Stellar Bodies

Stellar Bodies are planets, stars, asteroids, or other naturally occurring stellar bodies.

Stellar Bodies can be colonized if they are habitable. 

Structures can be built on Stellar Bodies regardless of habitability.

Stellar Bodies produce minerals

## Structures

Structures are buildings on planets, asteroid mining operations, or space stations.

Structures produce all of the 4 Core Resources.

Population, minerals, energy, and goods are all required to build and maintain structures.

Structures that require energy will not produce anything if they have no energy.

## Colonies

Colonies are made up of structures. The population that lives in them operates the structures.
Colonies can only be established on habitable Stellar Bodies.

## Population

Population represents the people living in colonies and on the player's ship.

Population is required to operate structures and run the player's ship.
The population of a colony will consume certain types of Goods.

If the population is on a habitable stellar body it will grow naturally over time and not all of the population will have to be associated with a structure.

## Ships

The player will have a starship to start the game but can also build new ships and upgrade their existing one.

Newly built ships can either replace the current player starship, be sent on missions, or set to follow the player's ship to form a star fleet.

All ships will have different offensive and defensive stats to determine their effectiveness in combat against other ships.

Ships will have 2 defensive stats: 1 for their shield and another for their actual health.

Ships will have several different attacks such as lasers, missles, and other starship attacks.

To establish certain types of colonies special "colony ships" will have to be built.
